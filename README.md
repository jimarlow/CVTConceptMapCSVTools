# CSVConceptMapEditor

A simple Tkinter-based desktop application for editing CSV files and visualizing them as concept maps. This tool allows you to open, edit, and save CSV files in a text editor interface, then generate concept map visualizations in PNG, SVG, or PDF formats using the [ConceptMap](csv_concept_map.py) class.

Propositions are used extensively in my book "Generative Analysis". This simple editor was created to help my readers visualize propositions as Concept Maps. Propositions are perfect inputs to Generative AI for the generation of code any many other artefacts.

## Features

- **Open and edit CSV files** in a plain text editor with syntax-friendly font.
- **Cut, copy, and paste** support via context menu and keyboard shortcuts.
- **Save** your changes directly back to CSV.
- **Generate concept map visualizations** from your CSV:
  - Export as PNG, SVG, or PDF with one click.
- **Simple, intuitive interface** built with Tkinter.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or newer
- The `csv_concept_map.py` module (must be present in the same directory)
- Additional dependencies for concept map rendering (as required by `ConceptMap`, e.g., `graphviz`)

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CSVConceptMapEditor.git
   cd CSVConceptMapEditor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   - Install Python requirements (if any, as specified by `csv_concept_map.py`).
   - For concept map rendering, you may need [Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/) installed on your system.

3. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   python csv_concept_map_editor.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Open a CSV file**  
   Click "Open CSV" and select your CSV file. The contents will appear in the editor.

2. **Edit the CSV**  
   Make changes directly in the text area. Use right-click or `Ctrl+X/C/V` for cut/copy/paste.

3. **Save your changes**  
   Click "Save CSV" to write your edits back to disk.

4. **Generate Concept Map**  
   Click one of the "Concept map" buttons (PNG, SVG, PDF) to render a concept map from your CSV file. The visual will be saved in the same directory as your CSV.
